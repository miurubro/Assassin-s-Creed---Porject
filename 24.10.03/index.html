                <p>Assassin's Creed Mirage is a 2023 action-adventure game developed by Ubisoft Bordeaux and published
                    by Ubisoft. The game is the thirteenth major installment in the Assassin's Creed series and the
                    successor to 2020's Assassin's Creed Valhalla. While its historical timeframe precedes that of
                    Valhalla, its modern-day framing story succeeds Valhalla's own. Set in 9th-century Baghdad during
                    the Islamic Golden Age—in particular during the Anarchy at Samarra—the story follows Basim Ibn Ishaq
                    (a character first introduced in Valhalla), a street thief who joins the Hidden Ones to fight for
                    peace and liberty, against the Order of the Ancients,who desire peace through control. The main
                    narrative focuses on Basim's internal struggle between his duties as a Hidden One and his desire to
                    uncover his mysterious past.
                    <br>
                    <br>

                    Originally envisioned as an expansion for Valhalla, the game was reworked into a standalone title to
                    expand its scope. The design philosophy behind Mirage—the first game to be developed primarily by
                    Ubisoft Bordeaux, previously just a support studio—was to return to the series' roots by focusing on
                    stealth, parkour, and assassinations over the role-playing elements featured heavily in recent
                    installments. As a result, the game is much smaller in scale than its predecessors and combines
                    elements introduced in them with those found in earlier installments of the franchise.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Mirage was released for <i>PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S on 5
                        October 2023, and for iOS on iPhone 15 Pro and iPadOS</i> on iPad models on 6 June 2024. Upon
                    release,
                    the game received generally positive reviews from critics, who praised its world design, focus on
                    stealth and return to form of the franchise, though some criticized the characters and the story's
                    reliance on previous installments in the series. Mirage's successor, Assassin's Creed Shadows, set
                    in Japan during the Sengoku period and returning to the role-playing style of gameplay of previous
                    installments, is set to be released in February <mark> 2025. </mark>

                <p>Assassin's Creed Valhalla is a 2020 action role-playing game developed by Ubisoft Montreal and
                    published by Ubisoft. It is the twelfth major installment in the Assassin's Creed series, and the
                    successor to 2018's Assassin's Creed Odyssey. Principally set in the years 872–878 AD, the game
                    recounts a Viking fantasy[5] story during their expansions into the British Isles. Players control
                    Eivor Varinsdottir, a Viking raider who, while attempting to establish a new Viking clan in England,
                    becomes embroiled in the centuries-old conflict between the Assassin Brotherhood, who fight for
                    peace and liberty, and the Templar Order, who desire peace through control.[c] The game also
                    includes a framing story, set in the 21st century, which follows Layla Hassan, an Assassin who
                    relives Eivor's memories so as to find a way to save the Earth from destruction.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Development of the game began in 2017, around the release of Assassin's Creed Origins. Ubisoft
                    Montreal led its three-year development with help from fourteen other Ubisoft studios worldwide, as
                    well as Sperasoft. Numerous people involved in the development of past Assassin's Creed games
                    returned for Valhalla, including Ashraf Ismail,[b] who served as the creative director for
                    Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag (2013) and Origins; Darby McDevitt, the lead writer for Black Flag
                    and Assassin's Creed: Revelations (2011) and co-writer of Assassin's Creed Unity (2014); and
                    composers Jesper Kyd and Sarah Schachner, who composed the game's soundtrack alongside musician
                    Einar Selvik. Similarly to Origins and Odyssey, the team conducted extensive research into the time
                    period to make the game world as historically accurate as possible, and drew inspiration from Norse
                    mythology for certain narrative elements. The team also sought to address some issues found by
                    players with Odyssey, such as its over ambitiousness, small focus on the Assassin-Templar conflict,
                    and the absence of traditional Assassin's Creed gameplay elements like social stealth.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Valhalla was released for PlayStation 4, Windows, Xbox One, Xbox Series X and Series S, and Stadia
                    on November 10, 2020, with the PlayStation 5 version following on November 12. It received generally
                    positive reviews, with praise for the narrative, characters, voice acting, visuals, soundtrack,
                    world-design and the interconnectivity of activities, while being criticized for its length,
                    technical issues, and repetitive structure. The game had the biggest launch in the Assassin's Creed
                    series to date, selling the most copies within its first week and becoming the second most
                    profitable Ubisoft title of all time. Ubisoft supported Valhalla extensively with two years of
                    additional content, including both free and paid story expansions, game modes, and events. The game
                    was followed by 2023's Assassin's Creed Mirage, which features a historical setting in Baghdad
                    during the Islamic Golden Age and follows Basim Ibn Ishaq, a major supporting character from
                    Valhalla.

                <h3><abbr title="Assassin's Creed">AC</abbr></h3>
                <p>Assassin's Creed is a historical action-adventure video game series and media franchise published by
                    Ubisoft and developed mainly by its studio Ubisoft Montreal using the game engine Anvil and its more
                    advanced derivatives. Created by Patrice Désilets, Jade Raymond, and Corey May, the Assassin's Creed
                    video game series depicts a fictional millennia-old struggle between the Order of Assassins, who
                    fight for peace and free will, and the Knights Templar, who desire peace through order and control.
                    The series features historical fiction, science fiction, and fictional characters intertwined with
                    real-world historical events and historical figures. In most games, players control a historical
                    Assassin while also playing as an Assassin Initiate or someone caught in the Assassin–Templar
                    conflict in the present-day framing story. Considered a spiritual successor to the Prince of Persia
                    series, Assassin's Creed took inspiration from the novel Alamut by the Slovenian writer Vladimir
                    Bartol, based on the historical Hashashin sect of the medieval Iran (Persia).

                    The first Assassin's Creed game was released in 2007, and the series has featured thirteen main
                    installments in total, the most recent being Assassin's Creed Mirage in 2023. Main games in the
                    Assassin's Creed series are set in an open world and played from the third-person view. Gameplay
                    revolves around combat, stealth, and exploration, including the use of parkour to navigate the
                    environment. The games feature both main and side missions, and some titles also include competitive
                    and cooperative multiplayer game modes.</p>
